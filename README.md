 <p> Herodotus is known to be the "Father of History" and according to some; also the "Father of Lies." History begins with Herodotus' Histories, which deals with the Persian Wars.
The Persian Wars are historically dated 492–449/448 BCE. However, warfare commenced among the Greek poleis in Ionia and the Persian Empire earlier than 499 BCE. </p>

The Greeks owe their naval success to a man named Themistocles. If it had not been for him then Athens would have not used some newly found silver to build 200 new ships for their navy. These ships were later used in the war against the Persians. The two forces were working in unison and they were dependent upon each other for victory.
